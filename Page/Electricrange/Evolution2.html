<h2>Reading parts Diagram</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
On the next several pages you will see a typical electric range breakdown containing the parts that
you have learned. Knowing the appearance of the part and location on the range will help you
identify it on a diagram. Most manufacturers present their “parts list and exploded view” in this type
of diagram.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
The diagrams are presented in a “facing the appliance” view, so when you are talking with a
customer make sure that when they tell you where the item is located that they are facing the
appliance, otherwise their left will actually be the right on your diagram. Many mistakes are made
because of this.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
Because the diagram is an “exploded view” parts are not exactly where they belong. Once you find
the particular section the part should be located in use the lines or arrows to follow the part back to
where it is actually mounted. This will help you determine if it is the part you are looking for..</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
Remember most parts do not include screws or trim, and most customers believe everything is
included, so it is very important that you communicate with your customer exactly what you are
seeing on the diagram. Also be aware of color; an example would be on page 9 in the diagram for
the Cooktop parts, item #3 is the “Cooktop” itself and it lists three #3’s, one for white, black, and
biscuit. Most customers are not aware that they need to tell you which color they need. Even the drip
pans on this model come in colors. Asking the customer what color, when choices are given, will
eliminate the guess work and ensure you send the right part the first time. On page 11 the diagram
item #4 for the burner switch gives you four choices according to the location of the burner you need
the switch for. On some descriptions you will notice a quantity in parentheses, usually that is an
indication of how many are required on that model, not how many come with that part number.
Asking secondary questions will allow you to get the customer all the parts needed to complete the
repair the first time.

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
There are many differences between what the customer is seeing and what you see on the diagram.
On the diagram you can not see color, size, or any small details that the customer may be using to
describe the part. This is why using the location and what the part does may be your only way of
locating the part needed. Although there are several websites that may give you a true to life picture
of the part, you can not rely on that.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
On many diagrams the manufacturer will offer parts as an assembly. They will indicate this by
placing a dotted line box around several parts. If the parts have an item number they are
available separately, if there is no item number they are only available as an assembly. Always give
the customer the option of replacing the assembly rather than just the one part. This usually makes
the repair easier and more complete.</p>

Take a few minutes to identify some of the parts and their locations in the diagrams on the following
pages. See if you can spot the eight major parts of the electric range.
