<h3>Evolution of the parts</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
 “I have seen a lot of changes in my day. A big one is the design of the <span style="color:rgb(247,147,29)">burner</span> going from the spiral coil (much like a
dryer element), to the Euro burner (which was encased in cast iron), to the newer designs using radiant and halogen
technology. In the very early days of electric ranges’ burners consisted of a spiral coil under an iron cover, and later
the CalRod element, a nickel-chrome alloy surrounded by a porcelain magnesium coating; both were wired right into
the range itself. Some of the older electric ranges had burners called mono-tubes that were so thick you might as
well have been talking to a brick wall they were so stubborn! I mentioned the glass-top ranges before; well some of
them have a different type of burner called a radiant burner, which is basically a coil encased in a high-heat resistant
housing allowing the heat to only radiate upwards. In the past there were generally only two sizes of burners, 6” and
8”. With today’s demands we are now being manufactured with burners in a variety of sizes from 4” to 10” and
everywhere in between. Older stoves only had three to four burners, while some newer models can have up to ten,
and that’s without even going to the commercial cooking category! I wouldn’t even know what to do with ten
burners! Although burners last a lot longer now than they did in the early days, consumers can actually wear them
out by sliding pans across them. Don’t do this, we don’t like it! What happens is it actually wears the coating off
the burner to the point that the alloy wire is exposed, and boy, does this make us hot! With that wire exposed, it can
cause a small explosion and sometimes even a fire. Do yourself a favor; be kind to your burners.”

 “<span style="color:rgb(247,147,29)">Receptacles</span> really didn’t exist as a separate part until burners could be plugged in rather than hard wired into the
range, sometimes surrounded by a glass or porcelain block. Usually the receptacle goes bad due to debris from
cooking that causes arching between the burner and receptacle. Today, manufacturers recommend replacing the
receptacle when a new burner is installed. Making sure the contact is complete between burner and receptacle will
extend the life of the burner. You should always follow the doctor–I mean manufacturer-recommendations for
keeping your appliances healthy and long-lasting.”</p>


<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
 “<span style="color:rgb(247,147,29)">Burner</span>, or surface unit switches, work by turning the switch to high or low, increasing or decreasing the amount of
electrical current flowing through the burner, thereby adjusting the temperature of the element. These switches are
located on the control panel and can also be called ‘infinite switches’, since there are an infinite number of settings
between low and high. On some ranges all the burner switches are the same, and on some models they are different
according to the amperage the burner needs to operate. (Amperage refers to the amount of electricity.) The larger
the burner, generally the higher the amperage. Some ranges get real fancy with an additional switch that allows the
consumer to choose different sizes all in one burner. They could make a single burner be a 4”, 6”, or 8” just by
making their selection to only heat up those turns on the burner, which adds an additional switch for selecting size.”

“<span style="color:rgb(247,147,29)">Bake elements</span> for the electric range are said to be the most even cooking in an oven as they cover more area in the
bottom of the oven cavity. This is where my brother, the gas range, and I usually disagree, but he’s got his
advantages too. Typically, the bake element goes bad due to spill-over of the food we are baking. The food lands on
the bake element causing a small grease fire that burns through the coating and shorts out the element. On newer
models coming out, manufacturers are now “hiding” the bake element under the bottom of the cavity to prevent
these problems. Proves to be great for the consumer but, makes it tough on the technician to get in there and
replace a bad one. Some bake elements are hinged to make it easier to clean up spills underneath. I have this friend
who is always bragging about how clean her oven floor is and she insists her bake element is not hinged, but we all
know the truth.”</p>
