<h3>Evolution of the parts</h3>

“Before the invention of the Calrod element, coiled bake elements were placed under the floor of the oven cavity to
prevent spillages on the coil elements that were then unprotected. Today, they are placing them there again and
calling them ‘hidden bake elements’. Some people have asked me if there are such things as universal bake
elements that all brands of ranges can use. Unfortunately, due to varying wattages, sizes, and shapes, each model
has a specific element that will fit in it. Self cleaning ovens use a very high wattage element that allows them to get
to the higher temperature required to burn off the residue inside the oven.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
“Oven<span style="color:rgb(247,147,29)"> thermostats</span> haven’t been around forever, they weren’t invented until 1915, and first on gas ranges only.
Electric ranges got thermostats approximately a decade later. The oven thermostat is located on the control panel
with a long capillary tube extending from it, which runs down the back of the range and into the oven toward the
top of the oven cavity. The capillary tube is what senses the temperature of the oven sending a signal back to the
thermostat asking for more or less heat from the bake element to maintain the temperature selected. So basically,
the thermostat turns the bake element off and on to maintain the temperature selected. Once the capillary tube has
been bent or broken off, the thermostat will no longer function. On newer model ranges, the thermostat has been
replaced with an electronic control board and a sensor, or probe, to cycle the bake element. The probe works on
resistance caused by temperature change, rather than by temperature itself, sending an electrical signal back to the
electronic oven control (EOC) or electronic range control (ERC). I’ll tell you what, you do not want to be around an
aging electric range when her thermostat starts to go out, talk about inconsistent temperatures!”</p>

“The <span style="color:rgb(247,147,29)">broil element</span>, as I mentioned earlier, is the element that is suspended from the ceiling of the oven cavity by a
bracket or clip. Most ranges do not have any temperature control for broil although newer ranges may have a high,
medium and low broil setting. Again this is done by cycling the broil element off and on much like the top burners
and bake element, just by increasing or decreasing the electrical current according to the setting.”

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
“The oven <span style="color:rgb(247,147,29)">selector switch</span> allows the consumer to choose whether the oven will bake, broil, self clean or time bake.
When these features first came out, our manufacturers had to come up with a way for us to tell the oven what to
do without adding a separate part for each function, so they are all on one switch. Nowadays, for the most part the
oven selector switch is being replaced by the electronic oven control (EOC) which is able to serve many functions.”</p>


<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
“In the beginning, the <span style="color:rgb(247,147,29)">clock/timer</span> was merely a clock and a minute timer combined; they had absolutely nothing to
do with the actual working of the range. The early clock/timers were analog and the maximum time you could set
was only about one hour. In today’s ranges, the clock timers, along with many other parts have been replaced by
the ERC, bringing electric ranges into the digital age. Older clocks were rebuildable, you could actually get
replacement parts for them, but that is not the case with the new electronic range control, where the whole thing
must be replaced. Before ERCs, some of the newer clock/timers gave the consumer the option of ‘time bake’,
where they could set the oven to come on and go off at certain times and to cook at a particular temperature. This
was a great feature for the working woman, allowing her to come home to a cooked dinner; however, it raised food
safety concerns because of meats being kept at unsafe temperatures until the oven came on. So, now they have
an oven that keeps the food refrigerated until the oven begins to bake!”</p>

“Electric ranges are all about convenience. We’ve come a long way from the old coil burners and simple switches,
to halogen cooktop burners and electronic controls that allow you to pre-program your cooking. By the way, I have
brought some diagrams so you can see how all the parts we discussed fit together.”</p>
