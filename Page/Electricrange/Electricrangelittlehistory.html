       “As long as people have known how to harness electricity, they’ve been using it for heating and cooking. The
Carpenter Electric Heating Manufacturing Co. invented the first electric stove in 1891, and in 1893 it was
showcased at the Chicago World’s Fair where an electrified model kitchen was put on display. But it wasn’t
until June 30, 1896, that a man by the name of William Hadaway was issued the first patent for the electric
stove.” </p>

       “Gas stoves, like my older brother, have been around for some time, but the electric stove took a while to become
popular. For starters, when electric stoves were first invented, only one in ten households were wired for
electricity. Moreover, electricity was very expensive back then and the first electric stoves required a lot of it.
Another problem with the early electric stoves was the short life span of their heating elements, that is, before
the nickel-chrome alloy was invented that could better withstand the heat. By the 1930s, our technology had
matured and we slowly began to replace the gas stove, especially in household kitchens (which was a major
source of sibling rivalry as we were growing up). The first technology used resistive heating coils which heated
iron hotplates, on top of which the pots were placed. As technology of electric ranges progressed, there was a
major emphasis on convenience. For instance, in the 1950s one of the features of the Westinghouse Emperor
range was a built-in cigarette lighter, and it came with a set of pans as standard equipment, now that’s
convenient!”  </p>

   “The big development in range cooking technology was the advent of the CalRod heating element, which was
introduced at the end of World War I. This element consisted of a wire surrounded with a coating of fine sand
and magnesium powder, incased in an aluminum tube. The big advantage of this design was that the
electricity running through the wire was not conducted to the outer casing so it was insulated and waterproof.
Now that’s hot!”</p>

 “The first electric range to use CalRod elements was built in 1928. The first self-cleaning oven was built in
1963, and in the 1970s glass-ceramic cooktops began to appear. The cooktops have a very low heat
conduction coefficient, but they let infrared radiation pass very well. Cooktops use either electric heating coils
or infrared halogen lamps as heating elements, and because of their physical characteristics, they heat quicker,
give off less afterheat, and only the plate heats up while the adjacent surface remains cool. Also,
glass-ceramic cooktops have a smooth surface and are easy to clean, but they only work with flat-bottomed
cookware and are significantly more expensive. Today’s major appliance brands offer both gas and electric
stoves, and many also offer dual-fuel stoves combining gas cooktops and electric ovens. So, you see, my
brother and I have found a way to work together and get along after all.”</p>
