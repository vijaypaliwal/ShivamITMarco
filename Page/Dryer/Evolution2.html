<h2>Reading parts Diagram</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
On the next several pages you will see a typical dryer breakdown containing the parts that you have learned. Knowing the appearance of the part and location on the dryer will help you identify it on a diagram. Most manufacturers present their “parts list and exploded view” in this type of diagram.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
The diagrams are presented in a “facing the appliance” view so when you are talking with a
customer make sure that when they tell you where the part is located that they are facing the
appliance, otherwise their left will actually be the right on your diagram. Many mistakes are made
because of this.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
Because the diagram is an “exploded view”, parts are not exactly where they belong. Once you have determined the particular section the part should be located in, use the lines or arrows to follow the part back to where it is actually mounted. This will help you determine if it is the part you are looking for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
Keep in mind that most parts do not include screws or trim, and most customers believe everything is included, so it is very important that you communicate with your customer exactly what you are seeing on the diagram. An example would be on page 9 in the diagram for the top and console, item # 10 does not come with the handle, item # 11. Most customers believe it to be one piece because when they pull it out, it comes out in one piece. Asking the customer if they need both pieces will eliminate the guess work and inform the customer of the fact that they do not come together. Again, asking secondary questions will allow you to get the customer all the parts needed to complete the repair the first time.

There are many differences between what the customer is seeing and what you see on the diagram. On the diagram you can not see color, size, or any small details that the customer may be using to describe the part. This is why using the location and what the part does may be your only way of locating the part needed. Although there are several websites that may give you a true to life picture of the part, you can not rely on that.</p>

The only difference between an electric and gas dryer breakdown will be the additional diagram for the gas burner parts. Don’t forget, on many diagrams the manufacturer will offer parts as an
assembly. They will indicate this by placing a dotted line box around several parts. If the parts have an item number they are available separately, if there is no item number for the individual parts they are only available as an assembly. Always give the customer the option of replacing the assembly rather than just the one part. This usually makes the repair easier and more complete.</p>
