            “Not to toot my own horn, but you‘ll probably all agree, that the microwave oven truly is one of the
most important inventions in home appliances during the 20th century. Like many of today’s great
inventions, we were actually a by-product of another technology. The idea for microwave energy
came about after World War II, when scientists began experimenting with the technology of
transmitting radio waves. They did experiments for years trying to figure out practical uses for this
technology in America. I‘m sure glad they didn‘t give up, otherwise I wouldn‘t be here talking to you
today!”   </p>

          “In 1946, the famously brilliant genius, Dr. Percy Spencer of the Raytheon Corporation– what? Never
heard of him? Well he‘s famous to us microwaves! Anyway, he was conducting an experiment with
radio waves when he noticed something unusual. Dr. Spencer had been testing a new vacuum tube
called a magnetron when he discovered that the candy bar in his pocket had melted. You‘re probably
thinking that the candy bar might have melted without the help of microwaves, since chocolate
has a tendency to do that. However, Dr. Spencer was intrigued by this, so he tried another experiment;
this time with our all-time favorite microwaveable snack food: popcorn! Dr. Spencer placed
a pile of kernels near the magnetron and watched with an inventive sparkle in his eye, as the popcorn
kernels sputtered, cracked, and popped all over his laboratory! The next morning, Dr. Spencer
decided to put the magnetron tube near an egg. This time he was joined by a curious colleague,
and they both watched as the egg began to tremble and quake. The temperature inside the egg was
rapidly rising, causing a great build-up of internal pressure. Evidently the curious colleague moved in
for a closer look; just in time for... POW! Let‘s just say the onlooker ended up with egg on his face. I
wonder if that‘s where the expression came from… Anyway, the melted candy bar, the popcorn, and
the exploding egg, all led Dr. Spencer to the logical scientific conclusion that exposure to
low-density microwave energy can create enough heat inside an object to cook it. Dr. Spencer
commenced further experimentation and eventually developed the first microwave oven, my
grandfather, the Raytheon Radar Range, which was later sold to and marketed under the Amana
brand. My grandfather, he was a tall fellow, and heavy too! He‘s really not that old, only in his 60‘s or
so, but he loves talking about the “good ol‘ days.”  </p>

       “Okay, so I know you‘re all wondering how a microwave works; trust me, this is exciting! In concept,
a microwave oven is actually a small radio transmitter that transmits into its own box; the box
the cavity that you put your food into. The radio waves I produce bounce around inside the
(cavity), and as they pass through whatever food happens to be in the cavity, the radio waves
the molecules that are in the food. The molecules rub together causing friction, which creates
that actually cooks the food from the inside out! See, I told you it was exciting!”</p>

   “Now it might seem that this cooking process happens magically, but I assure you there is no such
thing as a microwave magician. My uncle tried to be one, the closest he got was becoming a Magic
Chef Microwave. If you ever meet him, don‘t let him show you his disappearing coin trick; sparks fly,
and you‘ll be running for cover!”</p>
