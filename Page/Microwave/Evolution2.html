<h2>Reading parts Diagram</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
On the following pages you will see several microwave oven diagrams containing the parts that
you have learned. Knowing the appearance of the part and location on the microwave will help you
identify it on a diagram. Most manufacturers present their “parts list and exploded view” in this type
of diagram.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
TThe diagrams are presented in a “facing the appliance” view so when you are talking with a
customer make sure that when they tell you where it is located, that they are facing the appliance.
Otherwise, their left will actually be your right on the diagram. Many mistakes have been made
because of this. Because the diagram is an “exploded view,” parts are not exactly where they
belong. Once you identify the appropriate section the part should be located in, use the lines or
arrows to follow the part back to where it is actually mounted on the appliance. This will help you
determine if it is the part you are looking for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
Remember, most parts do not include screws or trim, and many customers believe everything is
included, so it is very important that you communicate with your customer exactly what you are
seeing on the diagram. An example would be on page 10 in the diagram for the door, item # 1 is the
complete door assembly; the individual parts are available but the assembly is also an option. Most
customers are not aware that they have these options. Asking secondary questions will allow you to
get the customer all the parts needed to complete the repair the first time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
There are many differences between what the customer is seeing and what you see on the diagram.
On the diagram you can not see color, size, or any small details that the customer may be using to
describe the part. This is why using the location and what the part does may be your only way of
locating the part needed. Although there are several websites that may give you a true to life picture
of the part, you can not rely solely on that.

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
On many diagrams the manufacturer will offer parts as an assembly. They will indicate this by
placing a dotted line box around several parts. If the parts have an item number they are
available separately, if no item numbers appear, they are only available as an assembly. Always give
the customer the option of replacing the assembly rather than just the one part. This usually makes
the repair easier and more complete.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
On many newer model microwaves there are very few parts available, so if the diagram only shows a
few parts--glass tray, turntable roller and the gear that drives the glass tray, that is all that is
available. The manufacturers consider these as ‘throw-away‘ microwaves and only offer two or three
parts for replacement.</p>

Take a few minutes to identify some of the parts and their locations in the diagrams on the following
pages. See if you can spot the eight major parts of a microwave.
