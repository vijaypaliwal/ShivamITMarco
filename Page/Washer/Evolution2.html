<h3>Reading Parts Diagram</h3>

  On the next several pages you will see a typical washer breakdown containing the parts that you
have learned. Knowing the appearance of the part and the location on the wash machine will help
you identify it on a diagram. Most manufacturers present their “parts list and exploded view” in this
type of diagram.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 12px;">

The diagrams are presented in a “facing the appliance” view. When you are talking with a customer
make sure that when they tell you where the part is located that they are facing the appliance,
otherwise their left will actually be the right on your diagram. Many mistakes are made because of
this.

Because the diagram is an “exploded view” parts are not exactly where they belong. Once you have
found the particular section the part should be located in, use the lines or arrows to follow the part
back to where it is actually mounted. This will help you determine if it is the part you are looking for.
Remember most parts do not include screws or trim, and most customers believe everything is
included. This is why it is very important that you communicate with your customer exactly what
you are seeing on the diagram. An example would be on page 9 in the diagram for the controls and
rear panel, item # 44 is the timer knob and item # 45 is the timer dial. Most customers are not aware
that they are two separate parts. Asking the customer if they need both pieces will eliminate the
guess work and inform the customer of the fact that they do not come together. Asking secondary
questions will allow you to get the customer all the parts needed to complete the repair the first time.
There are many differences between what the customer is seeing and what you see on the diagram.
On the diagram you can not see color, size, or any small details that the customer may be using to
describe the part. This is why using the location and what the part does may be your only way of
locating the part needed. Although there are several websites that may give you a true to life picture
of the part, you can not rely on that.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 12px;">

On many diagrams the manufacturer will offer parts as an assembly. They will indicate this by
placing a dotted line box around several parts. If the parts have an item number, they are available
separately, if there is no item number they are only available as an assembly. Always give the
customer the option of replacing the assembly rather then just the one part. This usually makes the
repair easier and more complete.

           Take a few minutes to identify some of the parts and their locations in the diagrams on the following
pages. See if you can spot the eight major parts of the washer.
