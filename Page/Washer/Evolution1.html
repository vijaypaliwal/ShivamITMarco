   “We have been using belts from the beginning. Some of us washers even have two or
more <span style="color: orange;">belts</span> to work the pump and transmission off the motor. Some newer washers have
been built without belts and instead have a “direct drive” design, working directly from the
motor. There are variations of washer belts out there, some are what’s called a “V” belt
and some have cogs, or little teeth, on them. I’m glad I don’t have the kind with teeth, I’ve
heard they tickle.”

  “Since the invention of the washer  <span style="color: orange;">motor</span> , people have truly become spoiled. One of the
first washers ever produced was the old “wringer washer” that was actually powered by a
peddle you had to pump with your foot. Motors are one of the first parts that made
washers “automatic”. As some of the more modern motors have gone away from using a
belt, they have changed a lot. For instance, they no longer need to have a shaft and
pulley to drive the belt. There are even separate control boards that control the speeds
and directions of the motor.”

  “The <span style="color: orange;">pressure switch</span>, also known as the water level switch, used to be repairable and
adjustable. If my low water level was not low enough the servicer could adjust my
pressure switch to a smaller amount of water, or vice versa for a higher level of water.
These days, the pressure switch is not repairable or adjustable. Now, they come from the
manufacturers with those settings and you can’t change them. Older washers only have
one pressure switch, but some of our newer machines have two: one for the water level
for the wash cycle and one for the water level for the rinse cycle. Before, you would only
find the pressure switch in the control panel, but in the newer machines, they may be down
by the pump. Wow, all these changes with the newer models are starting to make me feel
old!”

        “Water <span style="color: orange;">valve</span> are another major part in making washers “automatic,” and boy, are they a
blessing! Our water valves let in both hot and cold water. I’d say that’s a lot
better than carrying buckets of water to the machine for the wash and rinse cycles,
wouldn’t you agree? The water valve has gone through many changes, from
letting in only hot or only cold water, to letting in a combination of hot and cold
water, as well as dispensing soap, bleach, and fabric softener. Water valves are commonly
going to be found in the washer’s back, but with all those changes we were talking about,
they might be found in the control panel area on some models.”
“Now, of course there are many more parts to the washer, as we progress through these
diagrams, you will get to see all of them.”
