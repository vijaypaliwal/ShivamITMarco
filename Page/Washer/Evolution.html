   “Just as everything else has been changing from manual to automatic, so have
machines and our parts.  <span style="color: orange;">Timers</span> back in the 60s and 70s were re-buildable. When your timer
quit ticking the servicer would actually repair it by replacing the parts that were
defective. However, as time went by, fewer and fewer parts were available to rebuild timers
and our manufacturers began to encourage the replacement of the complete timer assembly.
Now, the modern washing machine timers automatically set the wash and spin speed, as well
as water level and length of time on each cycle, just by the consumer entering what type of
clothes they are washing. The control board, which is the timer in modern machines, knows
exactly what to do all the way up to choosing the temperature of the wash and rinse water. “

 “Early <span style="color: orange;"> pumps</span> relied on the belt and the direction the motor was turning to make the pump
either recirculate or drain the water according to what point it was at on the cycle. Those old
pumps were big, and had to use gravity to increase the speed of the drain cycle. Although
most pumps are mechanically driven, we do have some pumps that are electric, and have
their own motor, so we are able to move much more water in both recirculation and drain
modes. These days, some washing machines even have two pumps, one for each function,
recirculate and drain.”

 “<span style="color:orange">Agitators</span> way back in the day, used to be simple, one piece “clothes movers”.
Today’s agitators can be made up of multiple pieces with internal gears. For example,
Whirlpool actually has these tear drop shaped “agitator dogs” to help the agitator ratchet
back and forth, moving the bottom half and top half in opposite directions. Some of our
manufacturers are getting rid of agitators. My friend Frank Frontload doesn’t have one, but
he says he doesn’t mind. Front loads aren’t the only ones without agitators though, one of the
newest top load washers has a “washplate” instead of an agitator allowing him to use less
water and be gentler on the clothes.”

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 12px;">

     “The agitator sits on the <span style="color:orange"> transmission</span> whose job is to shift gears from agitate, which is the
back and forth motion, to spin where we actually start the process of draining the water from
the clothes. That top load I mentioned a second ago--he doesn’t even have a transmission.
He uses a leveler to change the position of the “washplate”, and he’s even driven solely by
the motor rotor and strator. Now, he sounds like a pretty cool dude, if you ask me!”
